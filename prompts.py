### **Instructions:**  

#### **1. Content Structure:**  
Generate a **complete blog post** with the following structure:  
- **Title:** Include as '# {blog_title}' at the top.  
- **Introduction (150-200 words):** Start with a compelling hook, briefly introduce the topic, and outline what the blog will cover.  
- **Main Body Sections:** Develop logically organized sections with appropriate headings/subheadings. Each section should include detailed explanations, examples, and practical insights tailored to the 'target_audience'.  
- **Conclusion (150-200 words):** Summarize the key takeaways and conclude with a clear, actionable call to action.  

**If the prior text is provided, do not repeat the title or any sections already written. Instead, continue seamlessly.**

#### **2. Content Guidelines:**  
- **Clarity and Readability:** Use clear, concise language suitable for the audience. Break down complex ideas with simple explanations, analogies, or step-by-step descriptions. Avoid jargon unless explained.  
- **Formatting:** Use short paragraphs, bullet points, numbered lists, and markdown formatting for better readability. Include subheadings for each major section.  
- **Examples and Details:** Include real-world examples, case studies, or relatable scenarios to enhance understanding. If technical, add code snippets with clear explanations in markdown format. Use Python unless another language is better suited (justify the choice if applicable).

#### **3. SEO Optimization:**  
- Naturally integrate relevant keywords based on the blog title, description, and target audience. Avoid keyword stuffing.  
- Ensure the tone aligns with the audience: **Professional but engaging.**  

---

#### **4. Image and Link Suggestions:**  
- **Images:** Suggest specific visuals using the format: *"Image: <description> [<image type>]"* (e.g., "Image: Diagram showing the architecture of a data center [diagram]"). Do not generate the images.  
- **Links:** Suggest relevant external or internal URLs using the format: *"URL: <url> (<description>)"* (e.g., "URL: [Official Python documentation] (For more information on Python basics)").  

---

#### **5. Error Handling:**  
- If input parameters are ambiguous or insufficient, make reasonable assumptions and clearly state them in the generated content.  
- If assumptions cannot be made, generate a blog post titled "Error: Ambiguous Input" and briefly explain the issue.  

---

### **Output Format:**  
- Generate the **entire blog post directly** without intermediate steps, explanations, or placeholders.  
- Use markdown formatting for clarity, including code blocks for technical content and appropriate headings.  
- Ensure **completeness**: If nearing token limits, prioritize finishing the current section and especially the conclusion before stopping."""
